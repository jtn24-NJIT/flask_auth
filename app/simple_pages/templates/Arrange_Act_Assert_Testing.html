    <strong> What is AAA Testing?  </strong> <br><br>

    <strong>Arrange: </strong> AAA Testing is a pattern of testing which helps structure test cases. Arrange, the first step
    of AAA testing, sets up the test cases. When first creating a test, upon the first step the user/developer should
    ask themselves: Does this test require any objects or special settings? Does it need to prep a database? Does it
    log into a web app? And so on, but ultimately this step helps ensure what kind of tests are needed and any prior
    requirements in order to properly test.</p>
    <br>

    <strong>Act: </strong> The second step, act, means to act upon the target behavior. This step should cover the main
    things to be tested upon a web application. From calling a function, method or REST API, interacting with a web page
    and so on, this step is focused upon the target behavior of a test.</p>
    <br>

    <strong>Assert: </strong> The final step, assert, means to verify a test's response/results. Stimulated by act steps
    that bring about said responses, sometimes these can be as simple as checking if the right word or number was returned.
    Other times, they might be used to check multiple parts of a system. Overall, this step just determines if a test
    passes or fails.</p>

    <strong>Example: </strong> The following image is an example of AAA testing, each line demonstrating a part of it. The first
    of arranging is the simple defining of the tuple object, which consists of the two numbers used per the calculation. The second
    of acting is a more advanced/important part of the test, in that it creates an instance of interacting with the Multiplication
    class defined in the dunder init file, which is located in the calculations directory. The final line is an example of assertion, in that
    it is asserting that multiplications is in fact a process of calculations, and that the provided data tuple is valid for it.</p>

    <strong>Why is Testing Important?: </strong> Testing is extremely important in programming as it allows for quicker and easier
    bug fixing and verification of working status. Without specific tests to deal with every aspect of an application, bug
    checking and fixing of any issues becomes immensely more difficult as the system does the work instead of something
    the user has defined definitively. For professional and collaborative projects, specific testing and following of defined
    testing patterns allows for both trust in all involved and clearer understanding of a project should it need to be modified
    or fixed.</p>
