    <strong> What is Continuous Integration and Deployment? </strong> <br><br>

    <strong>Continuous Delivery: </strong> A software development disciple, continuous development builds software so that it, "...can be
    released to production at any time." According to Martin Fowler, to achieve this the software: Is deployable throughout its life cycle,
    prioritizes keeping the software deployable over working new features, can return fast, automated feedback on the production readiness
    of the system any time somebody makes a change to them and can perform push-button deployments of any version of the software to any
    environment on demand. This is done by continuous integration of the software by the dev team, building executable and running automated
    tests on said executables. According to Fowler, "The key test is that a business sponsor could request that the current development
    version of the software can be deployed into production at a moment's notice - and nobody would bat an eyelid, let alone panic."
    In using continuous delivery, the benefits are as follows: Reduced deployment risk (smaller changes = less risk), believable progress
    (ultimately looks better in terms of progression) and user feedback (earlier and quicker deployment = quicker and more frequent feedback).

    <strong>Continuous Integration: </strong> A software development practice, continuous integration involves several members of a team
    integrating their work frequently (typically daily) that is verified by an automated build and test. The benefit of this is that it,
    "...leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly." This in turn
    allows for simpler integration (especially for larger projects). Originating from Kent Beck's, "Extreme Programming," while it may
    not require a particular tool it is useful to use a server for it (IE: CruiseControl). In terms of, "key practices," Fowler suggests:
    Maintaining a single source repository to help keep track of all the files and their changes with version control systems, automating
    the build to allow for easier introduction to a project for new members, make the build self-testing to easily catch bugs, etc. As a
    whole, continuous integration allows every collaborator to see what is happening and simplify communication.

    <strong>Project Implementation: </strong> To do this automatically upon heroku, changes are made according to whether or not we are pushing
    or pulling from the master branch. Specified in dev.yml and prod.yml within .github and workflows (directories). To effect the prod heroku
    app, a git push must be made to the master branch. Once that is done, it additionally goes through pytest, extracts metadata from Docker
    using specified credentials as well as updates the heroku prod app accordingly. To effect the dev heroku app, a git pull must be made from the
    master branch. Again performing a pytest, it then ONLY updates the heroku dev app accordingly with specified credentials.
