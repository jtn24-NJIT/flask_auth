    <strong> How Does Our Simple Calculator Utilize Pylint? </strong> <br><br>

    <strong>Our Simple Calculator: </strong> Throughout project 2, we had worked upon a calculator class with multiple
    different functions contained within separate directories. Throughout this page, basic concepts will be described
    towards the nature of testing in programming, as well as various principles and terminologies that are utilized
    to help best make our calculator easier to modify and in the future.</p>

    <strong>What is Pylint & Pytest?: </strong> Testing in Python is extremely important and beneficial, Python itself having created
    two particularly popular ways to test. Pylint is one of them, and is a tol which checks for errors within the code as well as
    enforcing a coding standard to ensure commonality. Looking for "code smells" as well and type errors, beyond more technical checks
    it also sees if particular blocks of code can be used to judge a code's complexity. While not the most perfect due to its automated
    processes (thus it may warn about something a user did intentionally), pytest however is more strictly defined by the user/developer.
    With docker/virtual environments, in creating a project a tests directory can be made and populated with _test files, upon
    running pytest within a terminal it quickly returns the result of each test as well as specific error messaging should one or
    more of the tests fail.</p>

    <strong>Encapsulation in Our Calculator: </strong> Encapsulation is utilized throughout much of our project, as every operations
    (add, subtract and multiply) are all isolated, static methods that have the simplest possible and singular operation to be
    handled.</p>

    <strong>Inheritance in Our Calculator: </strong> Inheritance is demonstrated within the calculations directory, in that it has
    two functions which are used in every instance in order to ensure the correct data is used (create, a classmethod for tuples and
    convert_args_to_tuple_of_float to ensure that any data would be converted into floats for calculations). </p>

    <strong>Polymorphism in Our Calculator: </strong> Polymorphism is demonstrated within the history directory, in that
    it has multiple functions with similar names and yet unique, overriding operations to keep track of specific operations
    as they are being used. Essentially, the method/process of getting an operation performed tracked into history is
    the same for everyone; but they have to be unique to ensure that they are properly tracked.</p>

    <strong>Abstraction in Our Calculator: </strong> Abstraction is demonstrated within the calculations directory, in that
    the class of Calculation consists of extremely simple functions that handle every operation. Since every operation
    obtains its values from tuples, only a singular tuple related method is needed. To ensure that all calculations
    can be performed without worry of different data value types being used, a singular method is used to convert them
    all into floats.</p>
