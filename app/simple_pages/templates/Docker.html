    <strong> What is Docker? </strong> <br><br>

    <strong>Containers: </strong> A standard unit of software, a docker container packages up code and all of its dependencies to ensure
    efficient, reliable and quick running of said application from one computing environment to others. Thanks to docker, a container
    allows for easy execution of a package of software as well as everything needed to run it (IE: system tools, system libraries,
    settings, etc.). These containers in turn allow for quicker and smaller ways to run applications without the typical usage of a
    virtual machine which requires guest operating systems and a hypervisor (in comparison to a container engine and singular operating
    system for docker containers). </p>

    <strong>Images: </strong> Automatically generated when a docker container is made, a docker image is a read-only template that
    contains a set of instructions for making an application run on docker. When ran, it can become one of many instances of a container.
    Made up of multiple layers (which build off from the previous layer with some changes), one of their advantages is that they are
    reusable, which means they can be deployed on any host and across multiple projects (thus saving time). Similar to a git commit, a
    docker image is like a snapshot of a docker container... but they are also immutable, making it so new software or configuration
    does not change the image.</p>

    <strong>Docker Hub Link for Project: </strong> https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jtn24/first-website </p>
    <strong>How to Run Project: </strong> <br>
    1. docker pull jtn24/first-website <br>
    2. docker images (use it to see image ID) <br>
    3. docker run -d -p 8080:80 imageID <br>
    4. docker ps (shows container ID) <br>
    5. docker exec -it containerID /bin/bash (opens a bash shell into the container) <br><br>

    <strong> <u> Docker Commands </u></strong> </p>

    <strong>Docker Pull Command: </strong> docker pull user/image, essentially the same as a git pull (gets an image to local from docker hub). </p>

    <strong>Docker Push Command: </strong> docker push user/image:tag, essentially the same as a git push (uploads an image from local to docker hub),
    often times the tag is the version being pushed.</p>

    <strong>Docker Images Command: </strong> docker images, essentially shows all currently running images. </p>

    <strong>Docker rmi Command: </strong> docker rmi image_id/image_name, removes an image as specified. </p>

    <strong>Docker ps Command: </strong> docker ps, shows information about currently running images. </p>

    <strong>Docker commit Command: </strong> docker commit container_id image_name:tag, allows for creation of an image from a container. </p>

    <strong>Docker start Command: </strong> docker start container_id/container_name, starts running a container. </p>

    <strong>Docker exec Command: </strong> docker exec containerID /bin/bash, runs a command in a running container. </p>

    <strong>Docker stop Command: </strong> docker stop container_id/container_name, stops a running container. </p>

    <strong>Docker Version Command: </strong> docker â€“version, shows the current version of docker that's installed. </p>
