    <strong> What Are Some Fundamental Parts of Git? </strong> <br><br>

    <strong>Branches: </strong> A light, movable pointer to the various commits of a Git project. By default, this points to the most
    recent version of the master branch. The functionality of this comes in being able to work upon different branches in order to implement
    new features, which in turn allow for easy development without worrying about effecting other working processes/features. The usage
    of branches are also useful in collaborative projects, in that they allow for different people to work on different features/branches
    without worrying of affecting the main branch/main development negatively. Branches can also be made at anytime alongside the main
    development branch.</p>

    <strong>Merge: </strong> Utilizing different branches, merging allows for the integration of different branches unto a singular
    branch. By default, this is the current branch that is being worked upon. Merging is often done in order to incorporate development
    upgrades or issue fixes unto the master, but some conflicts can arise from conflicts within specific files (IE: same file changed differently
    within the two branches). </p>

    <strong>Commit: </strong> Capturing a 'snapshot' of a project's current changes, a commit is essentially a 'milestone' of the
    git project. Recording the content of every changed file/every file being committed, each commit make up a git's versioncontrol
    and contain metadata such as contents, messages, the author, timestamps and more. Undoing a commit is also not recommended, as they
    can confuse collaborators within a group project; it is better to undo only locally.</p>

    <strong>Tags: </strong> Essentially markers within a repository's history, tags are used to note an important part within a
    repository's history (which are often marking points of version history). Tags within Git can be listed, searched for, removed,
    'checked out' and created within two types: Lightweight (similar to a branch with no future changes, it's a pointer to a specific commit)
    and annotated (stored as full objects in the Git database, they contain meta-data about the creator). Tags can also be shared to remote
    servers, but in order to do so they have to be explicitly specified. </p>

    <strong>Repositories: </strong> A directory or storage space for a Git project, a repository can be stored locally or online in order
    to keep track of code files, text files, images, etc. Repositories can be owned individually or shared for collaborative projects, and
    have no restriction on how many collaborators there can be (private repositories can be made as well, but they require a
    Github pro account). Public repositories as well are unrestricted in that anyone online can see them, and to ensure that Github does
    not its processing burned out, there are various limits set in place for various files (IE, raw text files over 512 KB are displayed
    in plain text). </p>
