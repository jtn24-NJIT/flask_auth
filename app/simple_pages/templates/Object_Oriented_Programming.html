    <strong> The Terminology of Object-Oriented Programming </strong> <br><br>

    <strong>Instantiation: </strong> The creation of an instance or template, in programming instantiation is fundamental to
    object-oriented programming. When instantiation is done in Python, a new class/object first created with dunder new and dunder
    init methods which are called whenever a class is instantiated. From this new instance, children classes, derived methods
    and other such important terminology and functionality forms.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Object: </strong> Any real world object or data type, in programming an object is an entity which has a state and behavior.
    Consisting of a state (the attributes and properties of it), a behavior (the methods of it as well as its relationships to other
    projects) and an identity (a unique identifier to allow for interaction with other objects), in Python an object must first have
    a pre-provided value known as self, and can have a dunder init method to provide initial values to any instantiated object. The
    image below provides a diagram of such.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Class: </strong> A collection of objects, in programming classes subsist of the base properties which the objects are
    being created. Containing some attributes and methods, classes in Python are defined by the keyword class, and have publicly
    accessible variables known as attributes which can be accessed by the dot operator. The image below demonstrates a specific
    example of a class called car.</p>

    <strong>Namespace: </strong> A collection of currently defined symbolic names along with information about an object,
    namespace is comparable to a dictionary data in that there is a set relation of key (object names) and values (the objects
    themselves). These fall into four types: Built-in (which contains all of Python's build-in objects which is available
    during the entirety of run-time), global (which consist of any names defined at the level of the main program and remains
    until the interpreter terminates), local (a namespace/function that exists within another function/namespace) and
    enclosing (which is the surrounding namespace/function that holds the local namespace). The following image demonstrates
    the scope/size of these different namespaces. </p>
    <img src="https://files.realpython.com/media/t.fd7bd78bbb47.png" alt="Namespace diagram">
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Constructor: </strong> Specific code, in programming a constructor is called whenever a new instance of a class is
    created. Preparing the class/object for use, they are similar to instance methods; but differ in that they have no
    explicit return type and are not implicitly inherited. They also have the task of initializing an object's data members and
    of establishing the invariant should the invariant be invalid due to some failure, as well as different rules for scope
    modifiers and usually the same name as the declaring class.</p>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Vxz6wK4wFI/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Constructor image">
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Fixture: </strong> Having explicit names and are based upon being reliable and consistent, in programming fixtures
    are utilized in testing and help initialize setup services, state or other operating environments. Accessed by test functions
    through arguments, each fixture often has a parameter named after it within the test function's definition. Having
    explicit names and usability to simple unit testing to complex functional testing, fixtures allow for easy 'teardown'
    logic no matter how many are being used and without concern for singular care per error. Fixtures are mostly used
    in the first step of AAA, arrange. </p>
    <img src="https://www.stechies.com/userfiles/images/py-fix-18.jpg" alt="Fixture example">
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Type Hint: </strong> Used for testing and error checking, in programming type hints are utilized to explicitly declare
    the data type of variables when they are declared. Available in more modern versions of python (3.5 or greater), when utilized
    they help ensure that specific errors (such as trying to use a string input for a factorial function) are caught, and help
    reinforce understanding of a code's architecture. The downside to using this however is that they somewhat penalize start-up
    time, but it is often worth it to implement type hints in order to allow for easier debugging should an error arise.</p>
    <img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/pycontw2017-170611053101/95/the-benefits-of-type-hints-27-638.jpg?cb=1497159443" alt="Type Hint example">
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Type Cast: </strong> Similar to type hints, type cast in programming is used to manually convert a variable data type
    to an acceptable form in order to prevent errors of incompatible data being used in functions. In python, type casting can
    be done implicitly (automatic conversion, no user involvement required) and explicitly (requires user input/manual setting
    of data types for the function being executed). The following image shows the potential data types that can be used for
    explicit type casting.</p>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CDO8UryVX5o/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Type Cast table">
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Unit Test: </strong> Singular/focused testing, in programming unit testing is the process of testing the individual
    components of a program/application. Breaking up a larger project into small, individual parts which have only a few inputs
    and only one output, unit testing falls into two categories: Automated (which is faster and more accurate) and manual (done
    by the developer/user, there has been a process however that has made this more efficient). With unit testing,
    the process of bug checking becomes more focused and singular towards specific functions as well as easier to remove
    test code when a final product/version is shipped.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Static: </strong> Lacking in activity, in programming static means that something (be it a variable, method, property,
    etc.) has an unchanging, preserved state even beyond their scope and throughout the program's runtime. Not initialized within
    new scopes, they can be accessed via dot operators and only one copy of it is shared by all objects of a class.</p>

    <strong>Instance Method: </strong> A basic method, an instance method must have one parameter of self which points to an
    instance of itself when called. With this parameter, it can freely access attributes and other methods upon itself
    which allows for easier state modification and modification of its class. The image below provides a diagram of all
    the methods.</p>

    <strong>Instance Property: </strong> Defined within a class, instance properties are properties that require an instance
    that is created with the help of the class name itself. Without these properties, these properties may not be accessible
    and can cause an undefined output error if they are left uninstantiated.</p>

    <strong>Static Method: </strong> Marked with a @staticmethod flag, static methods does not have a self parameter or a cls
    parameter, and thus cannot modify object state nor class state. They are restricted in what data can be accessed, and
    thus are useful for namespacing methods. The image below provides a diagram of all methods.</p>

    <strong>Static Property: </strong> Similar to an instance property, a static property is a property defined within a class;
    but do not change throughout the program's runtime. Unchanging, an example of a static property could be the voltage provided
    to a specific property in that this amount is (or at least per our example) unchanging.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Encapsulation: </strong> The action of enclosing something, in programming encapsulation is a fundamental concept of
    OOP in that it is the idea of wrapping data and the methods of said data within a singular unit. This in turn allows for
    privatization of variables and methods to prevent accidental modification, which in turn also prevents one type of data
    from accessing another and raises security/confidentiality of data. This in turn creates two types of members: Protected (which
    are members of a class that can't be accessed outside it, but can be accessed from within and are defined in python via
    prefix underscore) and private (which are similar to protected members, but the class members declared private are neither
    accessible outside the class and any base class... these can be defined in python via a prefix double underscore). </p>
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/97/94/af/9794af595762fd3d36f03c6ca168ac19.jpg" alt="Encapsulation diagram">
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Inheritance: </strong> The capability to derive or inherit certain properties, in programming inheritance is an
    extremely useful capability. Deriving properties from a base class unto child classes, inheritance is utilized as it
    helps represent relationships well, allows for easy re-usability without repetition and is transitive (class C which inherits
    from class B which inherits from class A also has class A properties). Inheritance can also be done in multiple levels,
    in that a child can have multiple base classes. The image below provides a diagram of this in the form of polygons.</p>
    <img src="https://www.dariawan.com/media/images/oop-uml-inheritance-polymorphism.width-400.png" alt="Inheritance example">
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Polymorphism: </strong> The condition of having multiple forms, in programming polymorphism is the same function
    name being utilized for different types. Being in-built or user defined, polymorphism allows for easier creation of multiple
    classes as well as usage of functions upon different data types. For example, the len function in Python can be used both
    to count the number of characters in a string, as well how many items there is in a list. When used for classes/objects,
    polymorphism allows for inheritance; which is used to share and allow for overwriting of common features. The image below
    demonstrates an example of this in the form of a 'parent' animal class, with two 'children' classes which inherit multiple
    features, but overrides/has a unique feature for each in the form of the sound each animal makes.</p>
    <img src="https://javatutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/java-polymorphism-featured-image-1280x720.png" alt="Polymorphism diagram">
    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Abstraction: </strong> The simplification of objects to just be broad/more important details, in programming abstraction
    is the process of making a class a sort of blueprint for more detailed classes. This is done in order to allow child classes
    to be build from an abstract class, which contains abstract method(s) which have a declaration, but not an implementation.
    This in turn allows for the quicker creation of child classes, as it provides a common interface for different implementations.
    In Python, a module can be imported to provide a base for defining abstract classes called ABC. The image below shows an example
    of this in the form of two abstract classes: A person and a job.</p>

    <strong>Overview of SOLID: </strong> Introduced in 2000 by Robert C. Martin in his paper, "Design Principles and Design Patterns,"
    SOLID is an acronym for 5 different design principles. This was made in order to create projects that were more understandable,
    flexible and maintainable. Each part of SOLID is more explained in the SOLID page, as well as an example of how a simple calculator
    project demonstrates the principles of SOLID.</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <strong>Overview of Design Patterns: </strong> In object-oriented programming, design patterns consists of description of certain
    objects and classes, as well as the attributes and dependencies of the class. Being reusable and thus able to speed up
    production, they can fall within creational patterns (which implement and support the creation of objects through
    using inheritance, structural (which helps define relationships between objects) and behavioral which define the behavior
    of said objects; facilitating communication between multiple objects).</p>
